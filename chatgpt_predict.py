The world has been witnessing U.S.' own desperate public attempts to question the outcome of its own elections at the highest level.1/2 https://t.co/8AOKvIZr1h - Alireza Miryousefi (@miryousefi) October 22, 2020\nOutput 1: supported\n\nInput 2:\nClaim: 'No one has died of cancer or heart disease since the COVID-19 thing started.\nEvidence: COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death after cancer and heart disease in 2020 in the United States, according to provisional federal mortality data.\nOutput 2: refuted\n\nInput 3:\nClaim: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign claimed in October 2019 that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed President Donald Trump for re-election.\nEvidence: Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking 'How could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not. (Sorry). But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform - and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters. If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they're deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It's time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable - add your name if you agree.\nOutput 3: NEI \n your output only needs to provide one of supported, refuted, or NEI, don't need to add 'output:'"},
